With the help of training data the program will be trained to understand the language.
Once the program is trained it can be used on any test data.
The algorithm is degigned for bigrams and trigrams.

Command to get the result:
$ python bigrams.py data/train/en/all_en.txt data/train/es/all_es.txt data/test/
